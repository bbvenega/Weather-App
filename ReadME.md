# Thunder Talk ‚õàÔ∏è

### About Thunder Talk 
Welcome to Thunder Talk, a simple yet powerful weather application leveraging GeoLocation tracking, live weather feeds, and more. This project serves as a highlight on my resume as I embark on my journey to secure software engineering internships.
Project Overview

Thunder Talk was created to explore the Python programming language and the Django framework. Prior to this project, I had limited experience with CSS, HTML, Python, and Django. Through this project, I built a fully functional weather app from scratch, showcasing my ability to learn and apply new technologies.
